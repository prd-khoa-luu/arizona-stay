## Customs/traditions/practices
* Eating out
  * In the US, it is generally expected that fast food restaurants offer free refills for soft drinks. This means that you can often refill your cup with your choice of beverage multiple times without additional charges.
  * When you enter a casual restaurant (like Applebee's, Olive Garden, or Chili's), a waiter/waitress may ask you "dine-in or takeout?" That means they are asking if you want to sit down and enjoy their meal on the premise ("dine in" or "eat in") or order their food to be packed and taken away to eat elsewhere ("takeout" or "takeaway" or "to go").
  * Customers are generally expected to clear their own trays and dispose of their trash at fast food chains (e.g. McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Burger King, KFC, In-N-Out, Arby's, Wendy's)
* Tipping
  * Standard (for restaurants): 15-25%
  * Counter service: 0-5%
  * At major fast food chains (see examples above), tipping is generally not expected or required
  * Automatic gratuities: 18% to 20% of the bill
    * Often automatically added onto the bill for large parties, with more than 5 diners in the group
    * You cannot refuse to pay an automatic gratuity since the payment is a service charge
    * You can tip a few more dollars on top of that if the service is great
  * When you pay with a credit card in a restaurant, the process goes like this
    * You ask the server for the check (the bill in British English) - see [Basic conversation - In a restaurant - Asking for checks](#basic-conversation)
    * You receive it, check the items, and put your card on it
    * The server will take your card and come back with a receipt and a pen
    * You write down the tip, do the math, and sign
    * Don't forget to take the receipt and/or a picture of it before leaving
    * <img src="https://github.com/prd-khoa-luu/arizona-stay/assets/81603101/2a8583cf-f906-4eb6-9c74-205e90e51b5c" width="50%">
  * For other services
    * Barber/haircut: 15‚Äì20% of the bill

    * Bartenders: $1 per drink, more for complex cocktails or large groups
    * Buffet: 10% if staff clear plates or assist you
    * Hotel housekeeping: $2‚Äì$5 per night (often left daily with a note for the housekeeper)
* "Bless you"
  * After you sneeze, someone may say "Bless you"
  * The proper response is "Thank you"

  * Riding in the front seat (when your friend is driving) is called riding shotgun
  * Claim the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun" when everyone is in view of the vehicle

* Barhopping
  * Definition: the activity of visiting several bars in succession, having a drink in each
  * Fun, but not recommended üò∫
* Online shopping and delivery
  * Delivery to the apartment complex
    * Required address components: recipient‚Äôs full name, street address with apartment number (this is essential!), city, state, ZIP code, and any necessary access instructions
    * Using the package concierge: receive a notification email or text from the system (or forwarded by the leasing office/National Corporate Housing) --> Scan QR code or use app --> retrieve package after locker door opens --> close locker door
  * Locker Pickup (e.g. Amazon Locker)
    * Self-service pickup points located in public areas (malls, stations)
    * Useful for privacy or flexible pickup time
  * Home address (for the house)
    * Packages are usually dropped off at the front door, and a proof-of-delivery photo may be sent to you via the app or email
    * Some packages may be hidden in the carport (on the left of the house, behind the trash bins)
    * Packages with high value may require identification
* Driving (not sure if anyone needs this)
  * Driver's license: an international driver's license or permit is not required, but you must have your Vietnamese driver's license physically with you ([here](https://azmvdservices.com/what-international-visitors-need-to-know-before-driving-in-arizona/), please recheck this yourself)
  * Renting cars
    * Most major rental companies require the renter of a motor vehicle to be at least 25 years of age
    * If you are younger than 25, you may still be able to rent a car, but there will be an additional daily surcharge
  * Make sure you understand
    * that the laws are different, and driving customs may vary as well
    * what to do if you're involved in a car accident üò±

    * If you anticipate a delay, inform the driver through the app or a phone call.
    * Double-check your pickup location. Use the "notes" feature if necessary.
    * Cancelation: If you need to cancel the ride, do so as soon as possible. Be aware that canceling too late may incur a fee.
  * Greeting & thanking: see [Basic conversation - In an Uber](#basic-conversation)
  * During the ride
    * First things first, always wear your seatbelt
    * Sit in the back seat unless the vehicle is full. If you prefer the front seat, ask the driver if it's okay -- [Basic conversation - In an Uber](#basic-conversation).
  * Tipping & rating
    * Tipping isn't as expected as it is in restaurants, but much appreciated. $1 is probably okay for short trips, otherwise 10-15% of the fare.
    * Give a 5-star rating if the ride was smooth and without any issues
* Hotel basics
  * Booking
    * Use online platforms (e.g., Booking.com) or hotel websites
    * Contact hotel (call or in-app) for special requests or info
    * Key criteria: location, reviews, free cancellation
  * Luggage keeping: Most hotels offer luggage storage before check-in/after check-out, sometimes for a small fee.
  * Amenities
    * Usually included: air conditioning (AC), Wi-Fi, towels, toiletries, housekeeping, TV
    * May vary by hotel: private bathroom (cheap hotels may only have shared bathrooms), in-room safe, mini-fridge, laundry facilities, breakfast
  * Incidental hold/security deposit
    * At check-in, hotels place a temporary hold on your credit card or take a cash deposit (usually $50‚Äì$200) to cover potential extra charges or damages.
    * This is not an actual charge, but it reduces your available credit and is released after check-out if there are no issues, though it may take a few days to process.

## Daily life tips
* Personal care
  * Hydration: Drink plenty of water, as Arizona‚Äôs dry climate increases dehydration risk
  * Sun protection: If you spend a lot of time outdoors, use sunscreen (SPF 30+), wear hats, sunglasses, and protective clothing
  * Skin care: Use body lotion regularly to prevent dry, cracked skin and bleeding, especially in Arizona‚Äôs dry climate
* Billing & payment
  * Cards & cash
    * Credit/debit cards and mobile payments are accepted almost everywhere
    * If you use credit cards, choose those with low foreign transaction fees and currency conversion fees
    * Some restaurants also charge extra fees for using credit/debit cards (card processing fees, usually 1.5-3.5% per transaction)
    * Some (Asian) restaurants only accept cash only or cash and debit cards
    * Arizona is considering a law to require most businesses to accept cash for purchases under $100
  * Bill splitting / group payments
    * Ask early: Tell the server if you want separate checks before ordering
    * Even or itemized: For similar orders, split evenly
    * Cash is easiest: Bring small bills to make splitting simple
  * Sales tax: Expect 8‚Äì10% sales tax added at checkout, not shown on price tags or menus
  * Price markup rule of thumb

| Purchase Type        | Add This % to Price | Example (for $100 purchase)     | Notes                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Restaurant (dine-in) | **+30%**            | $100 + $10 tax + $20 tip = $130 | Tax + tip + possible card fee |
| Restaurant (takeout) | **+10-20%**         | $100 + $10 tax + $5 tip = $115  | Tax + optional small tip      |
| Groceries            | **+2‚Äì3%**           | $100 + $3 tax = $103            | Some cities tax groceries     |
| Online/Retail        | **+9%**             | $100 + $10 tax = $110           | Typical AZ combined sales tax |
