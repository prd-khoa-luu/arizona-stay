    * Quick how-to: unlock trunk via app or in-car screen; use in-car screen for radio stations (music); double-pull door handle to exit
  * Uber Reserve
    * Schedule rides up to 90 days ahead with upfront pricing (including a reservation fee)
    * Driver arrives early (5–15 minutes before pickup) and waits longer.
    * If your card is charged when using an Uber voucher, it’s usually just a temporary hold that will be released after the trip.
* Scooter (Lime/Spin/Bird)
  * Download the app and put in your credit card info to use
  * You can put your phone in the phone holder
  * Lime
    * You can book and pay for Lime scooters via the Uber app.

## Customs/traditions/practices
* Eating out
  * In the US, it is generally expected that fast food restaurants offer free refills for soft drinks. This means that you can often refill your cup with your choice of beverage multiple times without additional charges.
  * When you enter a casual restaurant (like Applebee's, Olive Garden, or Chili's), a waiter/waitress may ask you "dine-in or takeout?" That means they are asking if you want to sit down and enjoy their meal on the premise ("dine in" or "eat in") or order their food to be packed and taken away to eat elsewhere ("takeout" or "takeaway" or "to go").
  * Customers are generally expected to clear their own trays and dispose of their trash at fast food chains (e.g. McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Burger King, KFC, In-N-Out, Arby's, Wendy's)
* Tipping
  * Standard (for restaurants): 15-25%
  * Counter service: 0-5%
  * At major fast food chains (see examples above), tipping is generally not expected or required
  * Automatic gratuities: 18% to 20% of the bill
    * Often automatically added onto the bill for large parties, with more than 5 diners in the group
    * You cannot refuse to pay an automatic gratuity since the payment is a service charge
    * You can tip a few more dollars on top of that if the service is great
  * When you pay with a credit card in a restaurant, the process goes like this
    * You ask the server for the check (the bill in British English) - see [Basic conversation - In a restaurant - Asking for checks](#basic-conversation)
    * You receive it, check the items, and put your card on it
    * The server will take your card and come back with a receipt and a pen
    * You write down the tip, do the math, and sign
    * Don't forget to take the receipt and/or a picture of it before leaving
    * <img src="https://github.com/prd-khoa-luu/arizona-stay/assets/81603101/2a8583cf-f906-4eb6-9c74-205e90e51b5c" width="50%">
* "Bless you"
  * After you sneeze, someone may say "Bless you"
  * The proper response is "Thank you"
* Riding shotgun
  * Riding in the front seat (when your friend is driving) is called riding shotgun
  * Claim the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun" when everyone is in view of the vehicle
* Happy hour
  * "Cheers"
  * The legal drinking age is 21 (which means you cannot buy, receive, possess, or consume alcohol before 21)
  * It is likely that you will be asked to show your ID before buying beer
* Barhopping
  * Definition: the activity of visiting several bars in succession, having a drink in each
  * Fun, but not recommended 😺
* Online shopping and delivery
  * Packages are usually dropped off at the front door and a proof-of-delivery photo may be sent to you via the app
  * Some packages may be hidden in the carport (on the left of the house, behind the trash bins)
  * Packages with high value will require identification
* Driving (not sure if anyone needs this)
  * Driver's license: an international driver license or permit is not required, but you must have your Vietnamese driver's license physically with you ([here](https://azmvdservices.com/what-international-visitors-need-to-know-before-driving-in-arizona/), please recheck this yourself)
  * Renting cars
    * Most major rental companies require the renter of a motor vehicle be at least 25 years of age
    * If you are younger than 25, you may still be able to rent a car but there will be an additional daily surcharge
  * Make sure you understand
    * that the laws are different, and driving customs may vary as well
    * what to do if you're involved in a car accident 😱
* Uber/taxi etiquette
  * Booking
    * Be ready to leave before requesting a ride. Don't make the driver wait unnecessarily.
    * If you anticipate a delay, inform the driver through the app or a phone call.
    * Double-check your pickup location. Use the "notes" feature if necessary.
    * Cancelation: If you need to cancel the ride, do so as soon as possible. Be aware that canceling too late may incur a fee.
  * Greeting & thanking: see [Basic conversation - In an Uber](#basic-conversation)
  * During the ride
    * First things first, always wear your seatbelt
    * Sit in the back seat unless the vehicle is full. If you prefer the front seat, ask the driver if it's okay.
  * Tipping & rating
    * Tipping isn't as expected as it is in restaurants, but much appreciated. 1$ is probably okay for short trips, otherwise 10-15% of the fare.
    * Give a 5-star rating if the ride was smooth and without any issues
